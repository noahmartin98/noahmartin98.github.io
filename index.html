<h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
<p>My software design and engineering abilities were demonstrated throughout the process of designing, creating, and deploying my web application. I started with a blank slate and built multiple elements that work together to produce my webpage. I originally created the application on a local server using a XAMPP software stack consisting of HTML, CSS, and PHP files. Once I had most of my project completed, I created a cloud server using Vercel to host the app. This was a learning experience for me, as I have never attempted to deploy a web application to a live web server. I had to do some research as I needed a workaround to allow Vercel to host my dynamic application with PHP files. Although it was a bit frustrating, it was a good experience for me.

<h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
<p>In the area of algorithms and data structures, I focused on adding features to my application and improve the efficiency of my code. One of the features that I added is the ability to switch between different season statistics and total statistics on the leaders pages. I accomplished this by adding a select element that reloads the page when changed, and using a GET statement to retrieve the selected value and update the table with a new query. I also added the ability to sort the tables and search for players using a javascript table library called DataTables. After linking to the library’s files, I just needed to make a few changes and write a small amount of javascipt to get the table sortable exactly how I wanted. Also, I added a new page that displays playoff brackets for the seasons in the database. To improve the efficiency of my project, I looked back through my code, removed unnecessary code, and simplified complex code. Originally, each php file had code at the top that connected it to the database. To simplify the code, I created a databaseConnect.php file which I required at the top of each page, reducing the amount of code needed. Also, this made updating my database information when I switched to a code database much less tedious, as I only needed to update one file. I also simplified many of my sql queries that were unnecessarily complicated. The processes of adding new features and improving the efficiency of my code allowed me to work on my programming using standard coding practices and code reviewing skills.

<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>The database portion of my project was what I was most looking forward to, as I enjoy working with them. I was able to go through the entire process of designing, creating, and deploying a database. I started by creating a database schema that fit my projects needs. Throughout the term, I made changes to improve the design of the database. One change I made was changing “team” from an attribute in the players table to an attribute in each of the statline tables. This change allows players to play for a different team in any game they play, which will allow the system to account for trades and other roster changes. I also changed “position” from an attribute in the player table to the statline tables for the same reason, created a position table to make keeping track of positions easier, and added a season column into the game table so I could filter results by season. To display my knowledge of SQL, I created complex queries to provide intuitive tables for the user. Once I finished creating my database on a local server, I migrated it to AWS for cloud hosting so that it is always available for my live site. This project provided me the opportunity to create my own database from scratch and integrate it into my project, which has been a great learning experience. I now feel much more confident about my ability to create and manage databases both locally and in the cloud.
